## Projects

| Title | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [AI/ML Blackjack Challenge](ai-ml-blackjack-challenge) | Use AWS AI/ML to detect and track playing card rank and suit real-time from a camera |
| [Automatic Anomaly Detection Tool a.k.a Sushi Detection](automatic-anomaly-detection-tool) | Use AWS IoT Greengrass with Nvidia Jetson Nano to use Machine Learning detection at the edge |
| [Autoponics: Happier Plants](autoponics/thing-app) | Python 3 app for controlling the sensors and actuators of the Autoponics thing |
| [Clash of the Soccer Bots](soccer-bots) | In this demo, you will see 2 soccer bots (NVidia Jetson Nanos) clash with each other and fight for a soccer ball |
| [Connected Photo Booth (Cerebro)](connected-photo-booth) | A connected photo booth built using a Raspberry Pi leveraging AWS Services like Rekognition and IOT Core to keep all the Cerebro's connected with Alexa providing the Voice interface |
| [Doodle Challenge](doodlechallenge) | Doodle Challenge is a multi-player game enabling you to compete against your fellow players, to see who can create the best doodles of a given subject |
| [Drone Zone](drone-zone) | Drone Zone is a multi-drone command and control environment powered by AWS IoT/Greengrass |
| [IoT Racer](iot-racing-ninja) | IoT Racer is an IoT and Serverless project that displays long-distance command and control capabilities via a 4 player game of tag |
| [Learn Languages with AWS AI/ML](learn-languages-ai-ml) | A casual game to learn languages with AWS AI/ML |
| [Polyglot Bot](polyglot-bot) | A greeter bot that recognizes your greeting language and wish you back in the same language with hand gesture |
| [Rhythm Cloud](rhythm-cloud) | Learn to play the drums and learn AWS IoT |
| [Skittles Sorter](skittle-sorter) | The Skittles Sorter automagically sorts your favorite snack based on their color, powered by the AWS IoT suite of services |
